# APA References

This program will format your references according to APA style guidelines.

*APA style dictates that authors are named last name followed by initials; publication year goes between parentheses,
followed by a period. The title of the article is in sentence-case, meaning only the first word and proper nouns in
the title are capitalized. The periodical title is run in title case, and is followed by the volume number which,
with the title, is also italicized. If a DOI has been assigned to the article that you are using,
you should include this after the page numbers for the article. If no DOI has been assigned and you are accessing the
periodical online, use the URL of the website from which you are retrieving the periodical.*
